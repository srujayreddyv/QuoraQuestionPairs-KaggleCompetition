# QuoraQuestionPairs-KaggleCompetition

1. In this Kaggle competition, I tackled the challenge of identifying duplicate questions. 

2. Utilizing a bi-directional LSTM within a siamese network framework, I employed binary cross-entropy loss. 

3. After extracting features from diverse sources such as tf-idf, word2vec, glove, and character n-grams, I fine-tuned my approach on a dataset comprising Quora question pairs.
